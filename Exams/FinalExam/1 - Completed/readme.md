# F01 - Final Exam (Practice)

## Overview

The final exam is entirely a problem-focused exam. In this exam, you will complete a combination of problems that will add up to the requisite maximum points (150 points). Most likely you will  do two problems

## **Attention**

READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY - ESPECIALLY THE PART ON HOW TO RUN YOUR CODE

- There are multiple problems to choose from - **you do not need to do them all**
- All the problems and the code you will write are contained in this SINGLE repository. 
- You do NOT need to create a Program class or main methods - This has been provided for you and all you have to do is flip the switch (see below in the section: Creating and Testing Your Code for Each Problem)

## Exam Rules And Hints

- You can use the following resources: 
  - Book, notes, 
  - slides from class, 
  - class code examples EXCEPT the Practice Exam Code (honor system),
  - internet searches EXCEPT searching for the solution itself
- You may not copy or save any portion of this test, so you must delete the test after submitting it. Be sure to verify that your work has been successfully pushed to GitHub before deleting
- If you are having trouble reading a diagram in the problem readme, then open the image directly from the images folder
-  It's easy to get overwhelmed by a problem. After understanding the basic objective for the exam, a good strategy is to first focus on the scaffolding from the UML: 1) classes; 2) attributes / instance variables; 3) operations / methods; 4) simple accessor / mutator implementations. After that, then focus on the logic components. It will be easier to get the logic done after the structure is in place because you can see what classes and methods you have to work with, plus you earn partial credit for the structure 



## Problems

[Problem1 - Traffic System](readme-p1.md)

[Problem2 - Document Communication Manager](readme-p2.md)

[Problem3 -Project Resource Manager](readme-p3.md)



## Creating and Testing Your Code for Each Problem

Each problem has its **own package** under the **src/edu/sbcc/cs105** folder (**p1 - p6**). You will create the classes for the problem in the problem package.  In each problem package, there is also a **Problem[n]**.java file with a **run** method.  If you want to create client code to run your code, create it in the **run** method. To then run that problem, change the **problem id** to the appropriate value (p1 - p6).

## Submitting Your Assignment

Follow the standard instructions for submitting a Java assignment: [How to Submit Assignments](https://canvas.sbcc.edu/courses/25771/pages/how-to-submit-assignments-new?module_item_id=761292). You do need to add the DONE tag.
